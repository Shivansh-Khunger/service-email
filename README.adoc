**iJUJU** is a location-based marketplace that brings you deals from local businesses as you're on the go. This is the official API for the front-end developers of iJUJU. While it's not exclusively focused on them, it is primarily intended for their use as of now.

A more polished public API will be available in the future.

This document provides an overview of the **iJUJU** _service-email_ API.

This service is designed to be highly scalable and reliable, leveraging the power of Cloudflare's edge computing network. It ensures that emails are delivered promptly and securely to users all around the world.
